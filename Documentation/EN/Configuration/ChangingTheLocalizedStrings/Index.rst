Changing the localized strings
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

You can change most of the localized strings that are used on the
front end and for the e-mails. (The localized strings for the back end
cannot be changed.)

When you want to change some strings, please don't change
locallang.xml or pi1/locallang.xml directly as these changes would get
overwritten on the next update. Instead, do it like this:

#. Find out the language code of the language for which you'd like to
   change a string. The language code for English is “default” and the
   language code for German is “de.” All other languages have two-letter
   codes as well.

#. Find out whether the string which you'd like to change is in
   locallang.xml or pi1/locallang.xml.

#. Find out the array key for that corresponding string.

#. In your TS setup, set the following (replacing  *language* with your
   language code and *key* with the corresponding array key):

- plugin.tx\_seminars.\_LOCAL\_LANG. *language.key* (for strings from
  locallang.xml) or

- plugin.tx\_seminars\_pi1.\_LOCAL\_LANG. *language.key* (for strings
  from pi1/locallang.xml)
